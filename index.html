            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Olayinka Ameye  <strong>Student ID:</strong> ALT/SOE/023/2351</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />My name is Olayinka Ameye. 
                I was born and raised in Ota, Ogun State. My family valued education, and I attended primary and secondary 
                school in my hometown. During my time in school, I developed a passion for mathematics and pursued this 
                interest further.
                
                I continued my education at the University of Lagos, where I studied mathematics education.
                After graduating, I began working in the e-commerce industry, where I quickly developed a passion 
                for this field and the opportunities it provides. I have remained dedicated to my career, and continue
                to grow and develop skills in the e-commerce industry.

                Outside of work, I enjoy travelling and exploring new places. I also dedicate my time to volunteering,
                and I find great fulfilment in helping others and making a difference in my community. In my free time, 
                I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, and I am passionate about living a healthy and 
                balanced lifestyle.
